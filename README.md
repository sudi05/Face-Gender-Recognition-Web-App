# Face-gender-recognition-web-app

A face and gender recognition web application using Computer Vision and Machine Learning. 

## Get started
Make sure beforehand that you have all the requisite libraries installed by executing `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
In order to test the web application locally, execute `python main.py` at the project's root to run flask server on localhost port 8000 (127.0.0.1:8000 in your favorite web browser). 

## Tech Stack
*  Python for backend
   *  Flask, a micro web framework used as a router and a template rendering engine
   *  OpenCV, an image processing library
   *  Pandas, a data analysis library
   *  Matplotlib, a visualization library
   *  Scikit-Learn, to build our ML models
*  HTML/CSS and Bootstrap 4 for the web-UI

## Applications
* The gender classification techniques can significantly improve the computer perceptional and interactional capabilities.

* i) Human-Computer Interaction:
     * By successfully determining gender, the system can provide appropriate and customized service for users by adapting to them according to their gender.

* ii) Surveillance Systems or Cyber Security:
      * By gender recognition we can assist intelligent security and surveillance systems to track moving objects, detect abnormal behaviors and facilitate the                 security investigation of criminals who intentionally try to hide their identity information.

* iii) Commercial Development:
       * Gender Classsification is useful for guiding effective marketing and establishing smart shopping environment in which production can be directed to specific            users through websites, electronic marketing, and advertising etc.

* It can simplify many tasks like for finding missing people, if gender recognition is known then we can eassily find them and it can also improve user experience in     mobile applications(apps) and video games.
